# Explore US Bikeshare Data - Python
This project entails utilizing Python as a tool to investigate data pertaining to bike sharing programs in three major US cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington. The use of descriptive statistics and data import are at the heart of it. The created script's final version converts raw data into an interactive and descriptive tool for every user, leading the project through required pieces of information.
